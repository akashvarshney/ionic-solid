      <h2 style="text-align: center;">OCP: Open/Close Principle</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="item item-text-wrap ">
      <p>The Open Close Principle encourages software developers to design and write code in a fashion that adding new functionality
        would involve minimal changes to existing code. Most changes will be handled as new methods and new classes. Designs
        following this principle would result in resilient code which does not break on addition of new functionality.</p><br>
      <p><b>Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. <sub>—Bertrand Meyer</sub></b><br> This was the initial definition
        given by Bertrand Meyer in 1988. But there was another definition given by Robert B Martin (uncle Bob) which is more
        verbose version of original </p><br>
      <p><b>Open for extension.</b> This means that the behavior of the module can be extended. As the requirements of the application
        change, we are able to extend the module with new behaviors that satisfy those changes. In other words, we are able
        to change what the module does. <br><b>Closed for modification.</b> Extending the behavior of a module does not result
        in changes to the source or binary code of the module. The binary executable version of the module, whether in a
        linkable library, a DLL, or a Java .jar, remains untouched.<sub>—Robert C. Martin, Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices</sub>
      </p><br>
      <p>For both sides of the open/closed principle, Martin explains in further detail what is meant by the key terms from
        the Meyer definition. To be open for extension, Martin explains, developers must be able to respond to changing requirements
        and support new features. This must be achieved despite modules being closed to modification. Developers must support
        new functionality without editing the source code—or compiled assembly—of the existing modules.</p><br>
      <h3>Conclusion
        <h3><br>
          <p> Like every principle OCP is only a principle. Making a flexible design involves additional time and effort spent
            for it and it introduce new level of abstraction increasing the complexity of the code. So this principle should
            be applied in those area which are most likely to be changed.
          </p> <br>
          <p> There are many design patterns that help us to extend code without changing it. For instance the Decorator pattern
            help us to follow Open Close principle. Also the Factory Method or the Observer pattern might be used to design
            an application easy to change with minimum changes in the existing code.</p>
